* Author: @danielcuthbert
* Rust requires you to expect errors and do something about them before they occur
* Rust has two types of errors: recoverable and unrecoverable
* Recoverable errors are errors that can be handled by the user
* Unrecoverable errors are errors that cannot be handled by the user
* Rust uses enum for recoverable errors
