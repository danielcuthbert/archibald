# Archibald 

To be a butler, is to be able to maintain an even-temper, at all times. One must have exceptional personal hygiene and look sharp and professional, always. Even when under stress or scrutiny, a butler must remain calm and lead their team through the difficulties.

Archibald is my attempt at learning Rust and writing a HTTP 1.1 web server.

## Disclaimer

This will not be production ready, it might eat your children and cause you to like Lotus Notes. I'm not professing to be an expert in Rust and therefore treat this as pretty dodgy.
